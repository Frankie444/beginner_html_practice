**Welcome to my beginner html practice repo!**
</br>
</br>
Here you will find one html file I have created, containing basic commands. There is a form within the file, but the inputs will not actually be posted anywhere (I haven't learnt how to do that yet!). 
</br>
</br>
If you have any suggested for the file, go ahead and clone, make a branch and PR :)
