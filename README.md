**Welcome to my beginner html practice repo!**
Here you will find a html file I have set up with basic commands. There is a form within the file, but the inputs will not actually be posted anywhere (I haven't learnt how to do that yet!). If you have any suggested for the file, go ahead and clone, make a branch and PR :)
